* Each project should build and run properly.
* Code style, code tidiness, comments are a plus.

Task 1

Language
Java or Kotlin

Description
Write a function that returns a boolean value indicating whether the string passed as an argument is palindrome or not.
Bonus points if the function is written as an extension in Kotlin.

Note: the function should ignore case, but consider whitespaces and other characters. Eg: "Radar" is palindrome, but "never odd or even" is not.

Note: you are free to use any library or paradigm you think fits best.
How to submit
Send us the complete project compressed and named 'palindrome.zip'.


Task 2

Language
Java or Kotlin

Description
Write a simple app that performs a GET request on this endpoint:
http://www.mocky.io/v2/59f2e79c2f0000ae29542931
The result should be used to display a list of posts to the user, with image, title, published date and description.

Note: you are free to use any library or paradigm you think fits best.
How to submit
Send us the complete project compressed and named 'rest-list.zip'.


Task 3

Language
Java or Kotlin

Description
From the app you wrote for Task 2, add a button in the toolbar that acts as a toggle. When the toggle is disabled (the default state) all posts should be shown, when it is enabled (after a tap) the list should only show the posts having user_id set to 1 and sorted by descending published_at. Tapping on the button again will return it to its default state.

Note: you are free to use any library or paradigm you think fits best.
How to submit
Send us the complete project compressed and named 'rest-filters.zip'.
